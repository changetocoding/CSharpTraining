### GIT BASH:

### CLONE
git clone repositorylink.git  
Eg: git clone https://github.com/changetocoding/WebLessonPlan.git

Right click within the folder you want to clone into and select "Git Bash Here"

After cloning, navigate into the folder to perform operations by typing cd clonedrepositoryfoldername

### TO UPDATE/UPLOAD A FILE TO THE REPOSITORY

git add "filename" (this instructs git to start keeping track of the file to be uploaded or updated)

git commit -m "filename" (this commits the file to be uploaded or updated)

git push


(To add all files!!!: git add .)

(To close out of comment window: :wq)


### TO GET UP-TO-DATE FILES FROM THE REPOSITORY

git pull


## GIT & VS CODE

HOW TO PUSH A PROJECT FROM VSCODE TO GITHUB (TO LINK A REPOSITORY WITH VSCODE)
- Create a new repository for your project
- Open the project you want to upload in Vscode
- Initialise repository from the source control panel
- Add a remote repository: view, command palette, Git: Add remote (Enter repository url (ensure it ends with the extension of .git) and set a remote name)
- From your source control panel, enter a message, commit changes and push changes


HOW TO PULL A PROJECT FROM GITHUB TO VSCODE (CLONING A REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB)
- Go the VSCode: View, Command Palette, Git: Clone (Enter the repository url (ensure it ends with the extension of .git) and select a folder where you want to clone the files)

Note: You can follow same process to clone the repository of someone else

## Github
Surprisingly hard to teach.
Think should split so step by step walk through steps of how to create a repositiory on github  
Clone that repository locally  
Add a file to it  
Commit set up stream then push to it  

Then update file in vs code  
Stage the file commit  
Push it

Then update file again/add a new file  
Repeat same in git hub  

Then repeat in command line.
